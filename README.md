# cw_toolbox
[ptpython](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython) repl and helper modules for comfortable interactive cw python sessions


## features

* [ptpython](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython) repl
  * paste complete scripts into the repl (if it breaks, the repl lets you inspect what went wrong <br> right at the point when 
    the error happened - similar to a break point)
  * fantastic auto-completion even into dict keys
  * repeat multi line statements in one go, not line by line
  * edit multi line statements
  * automatic doc strings (enable via `F2 - Display - Show docstring`)

    * selection
      * all selected element ids: selection
      * first selected element_id: s0
      * ...
    * sorted

## setup / install

* Clone this repo into `..\userprofil_28\3d\API.x64` so that it becomes a native button in cw GUI.
* Symlink / clone / copy it also into a virtualenv, which is currently (will be from env vars in future) hardcoded to: <br>
  `{user_home} / .virtualenvs / cadwork / Lib / site-packages`
* Expects the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` to be present in the above-mentioned virtualenv.

## known issues and limitations

* Only works within a cw session with the console enabled
* The console has a strange behaviour around pasting:
  * mouse right-click works for pasting
  * `Ctrl - v` `Ctrl - Shift - v` do not seem to work for pasting even with paste mode (`F6`) enabled
* The repl in its current version is modal / blocking, meaning you cannot interact with cadwork meaningfully while the 
  repl is active - quit the repl via `sys.exit()` or `rq()`
* Sometimes (~1%) it crashes cadwork - reason currently unknown

## roadmap

* show interactive model element stats from stats.py helper via altair in browser
* remove the need of a cw session with console / opening a new console on demand (help wanted)
* non-modal shell (help wanted)

## PRs and discussion in issues

* welcome!
